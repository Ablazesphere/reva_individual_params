# This file defines the mounting position of sensor_kit_base_link relative to base_link
# base_link is at the projection of the rear-axle center onto the ground surface
# Update these values after physical calibration of your vehicle

base_link:
  sensor_kit_base_link:
    x: 1.0      # meters forward from rear axle (typical vehicle center)
    y: 0.0      # meters (centered)
    z: 1.5      # meters above ground (typical roof height)
    roll: 0.0   # radians
    pitch: 0.0  # radians  
    yaw: 0.0    # radians
